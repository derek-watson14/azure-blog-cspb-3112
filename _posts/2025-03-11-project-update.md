## Original Project and Goals

The original idea of my project was to complete [Microsoft's exam prep curriculum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/?practice-assessment-type=certification) for the AZ-204: Developer Associate Azure certification. The plan was to complete one "learning path" each week over the entire semester, then take the 100-minute certification exam at the end of the semester so I have something tangible to show for my efforts.

I chose this project because the organization I work for as a developer is in the process of moving almost all software and applications to Azure from either self-hosted or AWS hosting, so I expect I will actually learn a lot of useful information. Furthermore, I think certifications like this one can be a great way to validate your knowledge to other potential employers in addition to academic degrees and experience.

## Changes Since

Nothing fundamental has changed since the original project proposal. I still have the sane end goal of completing all 12 learning paths by the end of week 14, and taking the exam at some point in week 15 of the course. There have been some minor tweaks however:

1. I missed completing a learning path in week 7, and now will need to do a make up post during spring break.
2. I am trying to add a couple "bonus" posts if I spend time learning a related Azure topic or if one week is particularly short.
3. Becasue I am covering the material over such an extended period, I may need to supplement the Microsoft curriculum with additional exam prep material when week 15 rolls around. I want to be sure to pass on the first go and I worry I might forget some of the minutia of the coursework from early in the semester by the end.

## Accomplishments So Far

So far I think my progress is right on track, excepting that one missing post. Missing that one I think is ok though, because in the schedule I had an empty week the week of spring break, so I can simply cover the material then. So far I have already learned a lot more about the following Azure services:

- **Azure App Service**: Full featured PaaS for hosting web apps and REST APIs at scale
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without managing infrastructure
- **Azure Storage**: Scalable and durable cloud storage for all types of data including blobs, files, and queues
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Managed multi-model NoSQL database service offering low latency and high availability
- **Azure Container Registry**: Managed private registry for storing and managing container images
- **Azure Container Instances**: Service for running containers on-demand without needing to provision virtual machines
- **Azure Container Apps**: Serverless container platform for running microservices with automated scaling
- **Azure API Management**: Comprehensive solution for publishing, securing, and monitoring APIs at scale

There are so many more to come in this course including event-based and message-based services, information about security and authorization/authentication and more. I think once done with the course I will have to tools to build just about any sort of application on Azure's cloud. 

## Reflection on Project Assessments and Completion

Here are the four project assessments I laid out in my proposal, and a short reflection on where I am at with each one:

1. Is there a blog post completed for each of the course modules listed above?
    - So far, so good. I have missed one post, but also completed one "bonus" post and have a plan in place to complete the missed content during spring break.
2. Does the blog have a homepage and links to all posts?
    - Yes. The blog does have a homepage and links to all posts including the project proposal/update.
3. Do the blog posts convey key information covered in the course as well as personal insights?
    - Yes, I think the posts are very in depth and will serve as excellent notes when working through practice exams and preparing for the assessment. I added a section at the top of each one with my personal thoughts on the course as well.
4. Did I take the certification exam by week 15? Success or failure?
    - TBD. I have not yet scheduled it, but I don't see why I wouldn't end up taking it. Perhaps at this point in the semester I should schedule it which will give me that extra motivation to work toward the goal.

Overall I feel really good about my project so far. I think the original proposal was pretty realistic and I have been able to put in the time required to stay on schedule so far.
