# Project Proposal

## Vision Statement
*The idea for this project is to document my learning journey toward earning the **Azure Developer Associate** certification from Microsoft by taking the certification exam.*

At [this url](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/?practice-assessment-type=certification) there is a course outline to prepare for the exam. Each of the 12 modules in the course are said to take somewhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete. I figure I can create a post for each module as a sort of study guide when the exam comes, and include some personal anecdotes about what I learned or discovered.
I work with Azure at work and I think this project would help me solidify my knowledge of some of the main Azure services I use such as `Azure App Service`, `Azure Blob Storage`, `API Management` and `Application Insights` to name a few. In the end, if I pass the exam, I will also gain a certification to showcase my new knowledge.

## Motivation
As mentioned above, I work with Azure almost daily in my work, and my orginazation is in the process of moving all of our projects and code that is currently on AWS over to Azure by the end of Q2 this year. We plan to use Azure exclusively going forward, so learning more about it will be highly beneficial to my day to day work. I hope to become a better Azure developer after completing the twelve modules, and learn about a best practices and fill some knowledge gaps from the ad-hoc approach to learning Azure I have taken previously. I also think professional certifications can be a nice thing to add to a resume, so that will be a bonus as well. 

## Specific and Measurable Goals
1. Complete all 12 modules in [this course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/?practice-assessment-type=certification), writing a blog post summarizing what I have learned in each
2. Study for and take the 100 minute exam, write a final 1-2 blog posts about that experience. Thankfully my employer is able to pay the fee for the 100-minute exam.

## Risks to Project Completion
The primary risk is that I get behing on completing modules and making posts. If I miss a week, I have twice as much to do the following week. If I miss two weeks, I have three times as much to do. I will be much better off if I can stay on a weekly schedule and spend the 3-4 measurable hours a week on my project as mentioned in the syllabus. The second risk is that I fail the final exam, which would be disappointing but not disasterous becuase I could still write a "what went wrong post". Anyway, I don't think that will happen if I can put in the time to learn the material and maintain this blog.

## Mitigation Strategy
As mentioned above: stay on schedule. Below is a schedule for the blog that I can follow to stay on track which should mitigate all risks:

## Project Assessments
1. Is there a blog post completed for each of the course modules listed above?
2. Does the blog function well and have navigation?
3. Do the blog posts convey key information covered in the course as well as personal insights?
4. Did I take the certification exam by week 15? Success or failure?
