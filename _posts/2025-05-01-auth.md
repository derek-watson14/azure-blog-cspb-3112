## Lesson 6: Implement user Authentication and Authorization

*Methodology: Watch each video in the lesson and take notes, summarize learning in "post-lesson review" section when done.*

### Post-lesson review
Was a good course, dont know if it had the depth required to actually pass the exam as it was somewhat surface level, but perhaps thats all that is required to know in order to pass. Was cool to learn about the graph explorer which will be a good tool in the future, I wish there had been more information about authorizing use of MS graph in an application beyond getting the user object, may have to supplement my learning here. 

<hr/>

### Video 1: Learning Objectives
- Authenticate and authorize users by using Microsoft Identity platform
- Authenticate and authorize users and apps using Microsoft Entra ID
- Create and implement shared access signatures
- Implement solutions that interact with Microsoft Graph

<hr />

### Video 2: Authenticate and authorize users by using Microsoft Identity platform

**About the Microsoft Identity Platform**
- Cloud identiy service/provider
- Allows us to build apps the users can sign in on using thier Entra Identities or socail accounts (LinkedIn, FB, Google etc)
- Single tenant apps are for internal business apps
- Multi tenant apps are for SaaS applications

At a high level:
- App Registrations
- Client SDK (Microsoft Authentication Library MSAL)
- Authentication and token endpoints (MS Entra endpoints)
- Can use: Work or School Accounts (Entra ID), personal accounts, socail or local accounts (Azure AD B2C), social or local customer accounts (MS Entra External ID)

**Components**
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard-compliant service
- Open source libraries
- Microsoft identity platform endpoint
- Application configuration API and PowerShell
- Developer content (tutorials, docs etc.)

> First step is to make an app registration
- Support for client, web and mobile apps. Single or multi tenant

<hr />

### Video 3: Authenticate and authorize users and apps using Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID 
- Formally known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory
- Works with MS 365, Azure Portal, Dynamics, and thousands of other third party SaaS apps
- Standatds-based authentication provider (built on top of open source auth providers like OAuth and OpenID)

Need to use Microsoft Authentication Library
- Enables devs to aquire security tokens from the Microsoft ID platform to authenticate users
- Secure access to MS Grap
- Supports different app architectures and platforms: .NET, JS, Python, Android, IOS
- Abstracts the underlying Auth Standards
- Supports several flows


**Example:**
- Add packages and usings
- Add code for interactive auth
- Acquire token using instance

Can use Visual Studio GUI to set up an ap that uses MSAL Authentication. It will put all of the authentication code in Program.cs and in the index.

It uses the graph service client to get a user and can then display that users info in the application.

### Video 4: Create and implement shared access signatures

- Signed URL
- Used to authorize access to a resource
- Includes token with query params
- Ex. When used with storage account, signature is built using one of the storage account access keys
    - This way you can granularly control permissions for access to resources (read/write/delete, time-constrained, etc.)

**Types of Shared Access Signatures**
- User delegation
- Service
- Account

These are best for legacy apps that cant used managed identities generally speaking.

**Demo**
For a blob storage container, under settings you can view and create shared access tokens and configure the granularity mentioned above. Expiration, start, IP restrictions, policy, permissions etc. This can be done from the portal but also programatically surely. Then once you have generated the token, you can copy it and add it as a QSP to the URI and suddenly you will be able to access the blob that was previously restricted.

### Video 5: Implement solutions that interact with Microsoft Graph 

**What is the Microsoft Graph?**
- Single endpoint that proxies multipel MS services, simplifying token aquisition and management
- Gateway to data in Microsoft 365, Windows and Enterprise Mobility
  - Unified programability model that allows access to all of this data
  - REST interface to access all of this data
- Enables devs to build apps that interact with data from multiple MS services
- Can be used with REST or SDKs

**Example**
- An application where you craete an event and the blocks are created in invitee calendars

SDK:
Microsoft Graph SDK is in:
    - Microsoft.Graph
    - Microsoft.Graph.Beta
    - Microsoft.Graph.Core

Extensive docs on how to do this using SDK. Can send an email on someones behalf using the SDK.

#### Demo 1: Microsoft Graph Explorer
- Search MS Graph Explorer as developer.microsoft.com
- Get connected to sample tenant in the browser to try calls
- Getting started has some examples (gives endpoint for REST and everything)
- Tons of examples including mail


#### Demo 2: Basic sample console app
- Create app registration in Entra
- Under auth, add a platform (select Web, localhost, add id tokens)
- `dotnet new console --name <name>`
- In VS Code add `Azure.Identity` and `Microsoft.Graph` packages 
- Create variables with tenant and client ids
- Create DEviceCodeCredentialOptions options
- Create new DEviceCodeCredential with the options
- Create new GraphServiceClient using the credential and a defined scope
- Then can get the user with `graphClient.Me.GetAsync()`, which returns a full JSON object with the info
- If you need more graph permissions, you need to go to the App Registration > Manage > API Permissions > Add a permission (same granularity controls as before)
